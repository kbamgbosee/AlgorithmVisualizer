# **Pathfinding Visualizer**

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application because I was trying to learn more about  graph algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them and see how they work on a more visceral level. I hope that you enjoy using this visualization tool as much as I am enjoying building it.

This application currently only supports Dijkstra's Algorithm, but there are plans to add A* Search, Greedy Best-first Search, Breadth-first Search, and Depth-first Search!
